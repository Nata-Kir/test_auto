# AQA needs to know about GIT commands
## **GIT PULL**
Is used to Update local repository to the newest commit
## **GIT FETCH**
When you use git fetch, you're adding changes from the remote repository to your local working branch without committing them.
## **GIT COMMIT --AMEND**
Replace the tip of the current branch by creating a new commit. The recorded tree is prepared as usual (including the effect of the -i and -o options and explicit pathspec), and the message from the original commit is used as the starting point, instead of an empty message, when no other message is specified from the command line via options such as -m, -F, -c, etc. The new commit has the same parents and author as the current one (the --reset-author option can countermand this).
# What's the difference between **GIT PULL** and **GIT FETCH**?
Unlike git pull, fetching allows you to review changes before committing them to your local branch.
